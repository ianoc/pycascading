"""Helper functions for a PyCascading script.

This module imports the PyCascading modules so that we don't have to import
them manually all the time. It also imports the Java classes wrapping the
primitive types (Integer, Long, Float, Double, String), so that casts are made
easy. Furthermore frequently used Cascading classes are also imported, such as
Fields, Tuple, and TupleEntry, and the pre-defined aggregators, filters,
assemblies, and schemes.
